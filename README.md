## What i used for this?
- MVVM architecture
- POP
- CleanArchitecture concepts
- MultiProject setup concept
- XCTests
- SnapshotTests (FBSnapshotTestCase)

## How to Run
- Got to the `ThirdParty` folder and install testing dependencies with:
`carthage update --platform iOS`

## Notes
- DarkMode is disable to simplify the implementation for now.
- Since the app is very simple and has only one Scene, there was no need to create something to deal with Routing or multiple flows.
